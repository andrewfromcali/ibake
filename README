   Say you know mysql really well, and are trying to get something simple done with postgres. (or
   vice versa, you might know postgres well and need to lookup a mysql command.)

   While both mysql and postgres have excellent documentation, you may not know the right term to
   look for in the foreign technology. Wouldn't it be great if you could lookup the postgres command
   you need by the mysql command you already know?

   Same goes for Java vs. Ruby. Maybe you've done Java programming for years and know that the
   method "trim" removes whitespace from the ends of a string. Wouldn't it be great to find the method
   that does this in Ruby indexed by the word "trim"?

   ibake is a publicly editable wiki of technology documentation, indexed over and over again by
   different terms so you can always find what you need by what you already know.
